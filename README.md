# Devshowcase

This is where programmers can connect and showcase their work to the broader programming community. Even better, they can find jobs with startups to gain expertise as developers.  
Developers can create a profile by including details about their schooling, projects they have worked on, and prior employment experience.  
For coders who are too busy writing code and don't have time to build their portfolio in addition to the resume/CV, their profile serves as a developer portfolio.  
They can also send the recruiters the URLs to their profiles.  
Developers can examine each other's profiles for ideas and communicate with their projects by leaving comments on each other's work.  
People can also write the developer directly with a message that is posted to the developer's email.  
This is a one-stop shop for developers to advertise their abilities and current projects.
